What is a Portfolio Website? 
A portfolio website is a unique platform that allows you to showcase your work and tell others about yourself. It’s like an online business card or CV that can help you find partnerships, show off your work, and even land your first job. 
Here are some essentials that a good portfolio website should have: 
Strong bio: Some interesting and fun facts about you. 
Recent works: Prospects need to know what they’re working with, your style, your abilities. 
Easy navigation: It shouldn’t be hard to find the information visitors are looking for. 
Creative mindset: People click through tons of generic websites all the time, make them pause.

How Do I make my Own Portfolio Website ? 
Creating your own portfolio website can be a rewarding task. Here are some general steps you can follow: 
Choose a platform: There are many platforms available for creating a portfolio website. You can use online website builders like Canva, or you can create your own from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly a framework like Bootstrap. 
Start with a template or from scratch: If you’re using an online builder, you can start with a pre-made template and customize it to your liking. If you’re coding your website, you’ll start with a blank slate. Add your personal information: Include a bio, your education, work experience, and interests. 
Showcase your work: Add projects that you’ve worked on. This could include photos, videos, or screenshots of your work. 
Customize your website: Make sure your website reflects your personal brand. You can add your own logos, fonts, and colours. 
Publish your website: Once you’re happy with your website, you can publish it. If you’re using an online builder, they will often provide you with a domain. If you’re coding your website, you’ll need to choose a hosting service.
